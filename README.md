## 🎯 Project Overview
The **Calculator Builder** is a React-based application that allows users to **drag and drop** different calculator components (buttons, input fields, operations) to create their own customized calculator.

Major tech use in this projects are **React**, **Zustand** (state management), **Tailwind CSS**, and **react-dnd** for a dynamic and interactive UI experience.

## 📌 Features
### ✅ Core Features
- **Drag & Drop Components** – Users can dynamically add, remove, and rearrange calculator components.
- **Predefined Components** – Includes number buttons (0-9), operations (+, -, *, /), and a result display.
- **Custom Layout** – Users can arrange buttons as per their preference.
- **Functional Calculator** – The logic ensures correct calculations based on user input.
- **State Management with Zustand** – Efficiently manages components and UI state.
- **Tailwind CSS Styling** – Provides a clean and responsive UI design.

### ✨ Bonus Features (Optional Enhancements)
- **Dark Mode Toggle** – Allows users to switch between light and dark themes.
- **Local Storage Persistence** – Saves the calculator layout so it remains the same after a page refresh.
